2. Optimize the smart contract code to reduce gas usage
3. Split large contracts into smaller ones

#### Transaction Failures

**Issue**: Transactions fail with a "revert" error.

**Solution**:
1. Check the transaction parameters
2. Verify that the sender has sufficient funds
3. Check the contract state to ensure the transaction is valid
4. Review the error message for specific details

#### Payment Processing Issues

**Issue**: Payments fail to process.

**Solution**:
1. Verify that the payment provider is active
2. Check that the payment method is supported in the jurisdiction
3. Ensure that the payment data is correctly formatted
4. Check the compliance status for the transaction

#### Compliance Checks Failing

**Issue**: Compliance checks fail for certain operations.

**Solution**:
1. Verify that the operation is allowed in the jurisdiction
2. Check that all required data is provided
3. Ensure that the user has the necessary permissions
4. Review the compliance rules for the specific operation
